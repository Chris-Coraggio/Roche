Welcome to Version 1.0 of the Roche Sample Annotator! Here are a few things about the application thus far:

To add to the list of desired tests for the chemical samples and/or the charge numbers,
please edit the corresponding csv files in the system folder of the master folder.

The master folder is established upon the first run of the program and currently cannot be
modified once designated.

Images and their edited counterparts are saved in the same project folder, so the option to begin
a new project is only necessary when you wish for a series of images to be separate from another group.

Please let me know of any problems, questions, or concerns that arise. I can be easily reached
through email at chriscoraggio1@gmail.com.

Hope this software helps! It was exciting to develop something for real-world application!
